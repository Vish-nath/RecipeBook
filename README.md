# RecipeBook
---
## Objective:
In this web development assignment, I created a Recipe Book web application. The goal is to allow users to add, view, and search for recipes. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this application.
---
### User Interface:

● A user-friendly interface where users can input and view recipes.

● An attractive layout using HTML and CSS.

● The interface includes fields for the recipe's name, ingredients, preparation
steps, and an image of the finished dish.

● Displays recipes in a clear and organized format.

---
### Add Recipes:

● Implemented a feature that allows users to add new recipes to the Recipe Book.

● Users can enter the recipe name, ingredients, preparation steps,
and upload an image.

● Validated the input data to ensure it's complete and accurate.

---
### View Recipes:

● Created a section that displays all the recipes stored in the Recipe Book.

● Recipes are presented in a visually appealing format.  

● Users can click on a recipe to view its details.

---
### Search Functionality:

● Implemented a search feature that allows users to find recipes based on keywords or
ingredients.

● When a user enters a search query, the application will display relevant
recipes.

---
### Storage:

● Recipes and their details are stored locally in the browser. I used
JavaScript to achieve this.

● Recipes will persist even if the user refreshes the page or closes the browser.

---
### User Experience:

● Ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. Users will be able to add, view,
and search for recipes without encountering errors.
